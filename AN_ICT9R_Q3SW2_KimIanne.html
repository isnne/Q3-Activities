		<h2 class="bg-info text-left text-light">What is Studio Ghibli?</h2>
		<p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, but Miyazaki and Takahata have a relationship that far predates this. The pair first worked together in 1964, marking the beginning of a collaborative relationship that would carry on throughout their careers.</p>

				<h3 class="bg-info text-light">My Neighbor Totoro (となりのトトロ)</h3>
				<p>Released on April 16, 1988, This acclaimed animated tale by director Hayao Miyazaki follows schoolgirl Satsuke and her younger sister, Mei, as they settle into an old country house with their father and wait for their mother to recover from an illness in an area hospital. As the sisters explore their new home, they encounter and befriend playful spirits in their house and the nearby forest, most notably the massive cuddly creature known as Totoro.</p><br>
				
				<p>This movie has been one of my favorites even as a little kid and it gives me so much nostalgia whenever I watch it. The story of the movie is sweet and magical. I would give this movie a 4.5/5</p>

				<h3 class="bg-info text-light">Whisper of the Heart (耳をすませば)</h3>
				<p>Released on July 15, 1995, this animated film follows Shizuku, an inquisitive young girl and a voracious reader, who longs to be a writer when she grows up. One day she notices that all of her library books have previously been taken out by one Seiji Amasawa. Amid chasing after a large cat, befriending an eccentric antiques dealer and writing her first novel, Shizuku aims to find this mysterious boy who may well be her soul mate. It is based on a manga with the same title</p><br>

				<p>This story is yet another fantasitical movie. It shows young love in a different aspect when she meets a guy who may be her soulmate. I would give it a 5/5</p>

				<h3 class="bg-info text-light">Howls Moving Castle (ハウルの動く城)</h3>
				<p>Being released a little more recently on November 20, 2004, Sophie has an uneventful life at her late father's hat shop, but all that changes when she befriends wizard Howl, who lives in a magical flying castle. However, the evil Witch of Waste takes issue with their budding relationship and casts a spell on young Sophie, which ages her prematurely. Now Howl must use all his magical talents to battle the jealous hag and return Sophie to her former youth and beauty.</p><br>
				
				<p>Since this movie has been released more recently, we can see the imporvement on the animations. This story has to be one of my favorites as the message really shows. It shows that we must face our problems instead of running away and it teaches the younger audience about love and kindness. I would give this a 5/5 </p>

				<h3 class="bg-danger">Pucca (뿌까, Ppukka)</h3>
				<p>Pucca is the niece of Uncle Dumpling, Ho, and Linguini (mentioned in the Jetix show episode Tomb It May Concern and the backs of some Jetix Pucca DVD cases). Pucca lives with her three uncles at the Goh-Rong Restaurant, where she works as a delivery girl. She drives around on her red scooter making deliveries to the people of the town. She usually delivers JaJang Noodles. Pucca also has a pink cat named Yani.</p>

				<h3 class="bg-danger">Garu (가루, Garu)</h3>
				<p>Garu is a dedicated ninja in training who has a very serious nature and he enjoys his own company and meditation. He has been shown to almost immediately accept a quest if told it will bring him "great honor." The reason for this, although never revealed in the TV series, most likely stems from one of Garu's ancestors bringing dishonor upon his family (as was revealed in the original Flash cartoons). He tries to uphold this by helping Master Soo so he can eventually restore his family's honor. Because of this, he is put into situations he doesn't enjoy but will put up with to maintain the honor.</p>

				<h3 class="bg-danger">Ring Ring (링링 Ling Ling)</h3>
				<p>Pucca's rival and the goddess of the wind and bearer of the Yang Curse. She usually tries to be better than Pucca in some way, but does not usually accomplish such a task. In Pucca: Love Recipe, she competes against Pucca for Garu's attention.</p>

				<h3 class="bg-danger">Tobe (또베, Ttobe)</h3>
				<p>Garu's enemy. He strives to defeat him at all costs, but is rarely capable of doing so, much less being able to handle Pucca. For some reason, Tobe is always trying to gain vengeance against Garu ("Vengeance!" is his catch-phrase). Tobe is fifteen years old.</p>
